# Concurrent Quick Sort for CSV Files

A GoLang command-line program for sorting a CSV file titled `big-numbers.csv` as quickly as possible using Concurrent Quick Sort algorithm.

## Description

This project demonstrates a GoLang implementation of Concurrent Quick Sort algorithm specifically tailored for sorting large datasets stored in a CSV file. By leveraging Go's concurrency features, the program efficiently sorts the numbers within the CSV file in parallel, resulting in faster sorting times.

This implementation placed 13th fastest in a code competition, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- GoLang installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/concurrent-quick-sort.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd concurrent-quick-sort


### Running the program

1. Place your CSV file titled `big-numbers.csv` containing the list of numbers to be sorted in the project directory.

2. Compile the program:

go build .

3. Run the compiled program:

./concurrent-quick-sort


4. Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the sorting process.

## Features

- Concurrent implementation of Quick Sort algorithm optimized for sorting CSV files.
